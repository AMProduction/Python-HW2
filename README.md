# Python Homework 2
## Conditionals and Loops. Functions
### **Task 1**
For a given integer **n** calculate the value which is equal to a:
1. squared number, if its value is strictly positive;
1. modulus of a number, if its value is strictly negative;
1. zero, if the integer n is zero.  
Example,  
*n = 4 result = 16,  
n = -5 result = 5,  
n = 0 result = 0*
### **Task 2**
Find the maximum integer, that can be obtained by permutation of numbers of an arbitrary three-digit positive integer n (100<=n<=999).  
Example,  
*n = 165 result = 651*
### **Task 3**
For a positive integer **n** calculate the **result** value, which is equal to the sum of the odd numbers of **n**.  
Example,  
*n = 1234 result = 4,  
n = 246 result = 0*
### **Task 4**
For a positive integer **n** calculate the **result** value, which is equal to the sum of the “1” in the binary representation of **n**.  
Example,  
*n = 14 10 = 1110 2 result = 3,  
n = 128 10 = 10000000 2 result = 1*
### **Task 5**
Create function **Fibonacci** for a positive integer **n**, calculate the **result** value, which is equal to the sum of the first **n** Fibonacci numbers.  
Note. Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each next number is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (F0=0,
F1=F2=1, then F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) for n>2)  
Example,  
n=8 result=33  
n = 11 result = 143
### **Task 6**
Create function **IsSorted**, determining whether a given **array** of integer values of arbitrary length is sorted in a given **order** (the order is set up by enum value **SortOrder**). Array and sort order are passed by parameters. Function does not change the array.
